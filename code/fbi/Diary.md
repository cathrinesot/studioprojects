For some reason my df size becomes seventy two rows, so I check the shape of my dataframe all the time to make sure is correct.

Opened the data in open Refine to clean and check the ages. 
I got 14 cases where the offender is 1 year old, but this is not correct, those values should have been unknown
same for 2 years old - example 2 years old father
