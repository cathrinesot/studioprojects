Summary 

I found an interesting dataset with UFOs sightings over the years in National UFO Reporting Center and I thought that it will be nice to map the UFOs appearances and the most common shapes and colors of them. Also maybe there are some trends, like:
 In California appear red fireballs and in Toronto Blue Disks. 
The visualization could be a map with the number of the sightings and when you hover over the point the most common shape of this area could appear. Or if we want a not clickable viz I could try to make a timeline, but I donâ€™t know how. 
The viz could be like this:

Possible Headlines:
UFOs fashion trends, what is the trend for 2017.
States attractive to UFOs.
Dateset: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html
Problems: The dataset is huge and selenium crashes after a while, I used a sample and I will try to find a way to get all the data. 
Also I have to do some digging, because I stumbled upon some articles about Area 51 and the Roswell Incident in 1947 and I believe that around those areas - dates there should be traffic. 

Work so far:
I scraped a dataset for the last month, cleaned it and plot this graph about shapes:
