Homeless people

Notes: a MO-604 covers territory in both Missouri and Kansas. The record described in this file represents the CoC's total territory, the sum of the housing inventory counts the CoC separately reported for the portions of its territory in MO and in KS. However, in the companion file, Housing Inventory Count by State, MO-604's data have been split up between MO and KS.

* Categories added in 2011 - Homeless Veterans !!! so the numbers skyrocket from 2010 to 2011 ! They did not say if there werenâ€™t homeless veterans before
